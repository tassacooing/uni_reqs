# Requirements for international students

### Application Process and General Requirements ([general information](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/studienangebot/international/propaedeutikum.html))
1. Proof of sufficient knowledge of german language within the enrollment
  deadline (its not possible to submit them later)

      - It exists two tests: <span style="color:red">DSH</span> and <span
        style="color:red">TestDaF</span> ([Language tests](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/bewerbung/international/studium-mit-abschluss/sprachkenntnisse/deutschkenntnisse.html))
      - DSH might be a little bit more difficult because it is in person.
        TestDaF is (as far as I know) online and some questions are multiple
        choice, so the grammatical part might be more easy.
      - [German Language Proficiency](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/bewerbung/international/studium-mit-abschluss/sprachkenntnisse/deutschkenntnisse.html)

2. Recognition of foreign educational qualifications

    - Recognition is for free in the application portal of Uni Hamburg ([application portal](https://www.stine.uni-hamburg.de/) - see application on the top left corner); Deadlines are 01.10. - 30.06.
    - Notice [country-specific information](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/bewerbung/international/studium-mit-abschluss/anerkennung-auslaendischer-schulbildung/10-laenderhinweise.html)
    - Notice [academic aptitude
      test](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/bewerbung/international/studium-mit-abschluss/studierfaehigkeitstest.html) - this can raise chances to get accepted
    - You can collect bonus-points with good language certificates and other
      stuff ([bonus
      points](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/studienorganisation/formulare-informationsmerkblaetter/zulassungskriterien-bewerbung-nicht-eu.pdf))
    - Notice [Pre-semester preparatory course for international
      students](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/studienangebot/international/propaedeutikum.html) - It helps to prepare for studying here and gives you a bonus. Also notice that the requirements for the german language certificate that you need for the preparatory course itself  are lower than the requirements to study. However you can use the successfull participation in the preparatory course as a proof of sufficient knowledge of german language to study if your grade in the german course there is "good" or better.

3. Application

    - Its an online form, just see on the website

### Specific information for B.A. Bewegungswissenschaft
Requirements are:

- medical certificate of suitability for sports (I guess from a german doctor)
- German First Aid certificate
- German Swimming badge (DSA) "gold"

For the application you have to go the normal process (see the information
above). Furthermore you need to choose a minor subject because this B.A. at itself is not counted as full studies. You can find those subjectes [here](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/studienangebot.html), where is a "yes" in the column "as MS". See also the [information for minor subjects](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/campuscenter/studienangebot/nebenfaecher.html).
